# Nested Debian MacOS

*This is just a repository to store all the manual manupulations that I need to perform currently*
*For others adjustments, I take elements from my "better_bookworm" repository*

**Subject :**
- Collection of manual adjustments to have a fully running Debian VM through my in-development app

**Requirements :**
- MacOS 15+
- M3+ CPU

Nested Virtualization is enable through Apple Virtualization framework

## Installation of Debian
Assisted Partition Manager doesn't run well as there's 2 partitions through Apple Virtualization.

My way is to create :
- a 1st partition of 256MB with EFI label
- a 2nd one as EXT4 with the rest of the empty space, with "discard" and "noatime"
- to have a light VM, install only "usual utilities"
- for SSH access, add "SSH server"

## Add Cut and Paste function :
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install spice-vdagent
```

## Configure keyboard
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```
*for the - you have to found the US ANSI layout in a first time*

later tips to come to adjust keyboard settings
*And I hope to find a way to fix ANSI /ISO keyboard conversion*
*Apple Framework considers keyboard only in ANSI configuration*
*but I believe what a swap-key tips could make the job*

On /etc/default/keyboard, to have full access to mac keyboard combinaisons:
```
XKBOPTIONS="lv3:switch,compose:lwin‚Äù
```

## Minimal Desktop
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-shell gnome-console nautilus plymouth-themes -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge gnome-shell-extension-prefs -y
```
Flatpak is usefull to manage easily gnome extensions :
```
sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak -y
sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak update
flatpak install com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager
```

## Adjust boot
*Because we are in a VM, there's no need to wait for Grub boot time."
```bash
sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt
```
then edit grub :
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
And change the configuration :
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="fsck.mode=skip quiet splash loglevel=3
GRUB_BACKGROUND=""
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
```
Then update the configuration :
```bash
sudo update-grub
```

## Adjust desktop scale
*To match the size of MacOS interface*

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/90_hidpi.gschema.override
```
Add in the empty file:
```bash
[org.gnome.desktop.interface]
scaling-factor=2
```
ctrl+x to save

then :
```bash
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
```

## Adjust network interface
```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.conf
```
and remove everything after :
```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```
*Gnome can now manage the network*
